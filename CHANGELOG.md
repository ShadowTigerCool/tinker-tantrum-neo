## 1.1.0
First Big Update

Added 4 new Modifiers
- Overcharging: applicable to Weapons, adds 1 Overslime to equipped armor that will take it every X (default 5) hits.
- Overmending: when equipped, the item will collect Experience and into a small internal buffer, converting it to Overslime over time. Ineffective without Overslime. Inspired By TCon2's Mending Moss.
Alex's Caves compat
- Ferromagnetic: Makes the item be considered Ferromagnetic to Alex's Caves content. (pulled/repelled by Neodymium, etc.) Usage with a Galena Gauntlet requires a second level, which requires an Ability slot.
Vein Mining compat
- Vein Mining: Allows the tool to do Vein Mining, by briefly applying the Enchantment through TConstruct's systems. If the level is higher than the maximum level for the Vein Mining enchantment, it will be treated as that maximum level instead.

Added 1 new Material
Amethyst Additions (by adam9899)
- Enchanted Alloy: a quite Durable, but somewhat slow material that can only be used for Heads, Tool Rods, and Bindings. Comes with Vein Mining as a trait.


Added entries to the Encyclopedia of Tinkering for all Modifiers, aswell as flavor text for Materials


## 1.0.0
Initial Release

Contains the Quarky and Overcharging modifiers.
    - Quarky: Increases damage a little based on how many items from mods by Vazkii are on your Hotbar.
    - Overcharging: Attacking builds charge on the Weapon, which adds some Overslime to your equipped armor when it fills.
